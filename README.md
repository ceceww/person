# Person
Implementation of a hierarchy of five classes where the base class is "Person" with some basic features and the derived classes are Customer, Employee, Manager and Consultant where Manager and Consultant are derived from Employee. Explores the notion of inheritance and virtual functions.  

The details regarding the implementation of these classes are given in the Person.h header file. All five classes are implemented in a single pair of .h and .cpp files for convenience.   

A description is given in "description.pdf".   

Person.cpp contains implementation of the methods.   
The signatures of the classes and their methods are given in the file Person.h.   
The file main.cpp contains illustration of some basic usage.  
The makefile will attempt to build the main file.  

## Provided Files

* Person.h  
* Person.cpp  
* main.cpp  
* makefile   

## Test Suite

* Tester.h  
* Tester.cpp  
* TestPart1.cpp  

The makefile above will attempt to build the file TestPart1 which can be used to test the program. The way to execute the tests (with options a to l) is:   

./TestPart1 a   
./TestPart1 b   
...
